# 🔧 Netlify Deployment Error - FIXED!

## ❌ Error Encountered

```
Failed during stage 'Reading and parsing configuration files': 
When resolving config:
Base directory does not exist: /opt/build/repo/root
```

---

## ✅ Solution

### Issue
Netlify was looking for a base directory called "root" that doesn't exist in the repository.

### Fix Applied
Updated `netlify.toml` with correct configuration:
- ✅ Set `base = ""` (empty = root of repo)
- ✅ Added `npm install` to build command
- ✅ Confirmed `publish = "dist"` directory

## 🚀 How to Deploy to Netlify

### Method 1: Connect GitHub Repository (Recommended)

**Step 1: Push your code to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

**Step 2: Deploy on Netlify**
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click **"Add new site"** → **"Import an existing project"**
3. Choose **GitHub**
4. Select repository: **devTechs001/e-folio**
5. Branch to deploy: **main** (NOT gh-pages)
6. Build settings (auto-detected from netlify.toml):
   - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Base directory: (leave empty)
7. Click **"Deploy site"**

**Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**
After site is created, go to:
- Site settings → Environment variables → Add variables:
```
VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend-url.com
VITE_SOCKET_URL = https://your-backend-url.com
```

### Method 2: Netlify CLI

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Initialize site
netlify init

# Deploy to production
netlify deploy --prod
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Deploy from Main Branch, NOT gh-pages
- ✅ Deploy from: **main** branch
- ❌ Don't deploy from: **gh-pages** branch

**Why?**
- `gh-pages` branch contains pre-built files
- Netlify needs source code to build
- `main` branch has the source code

### For GitHub Pages
The `gh-pages` branch is specifically for GitHub Pages deployment:
```bash
npm run deploy  # Deploys to gh-pages branch
```

### For Netlify
Deploy from the `main` branch with source code.

- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub main branch
- [ ] Netlify site connected to GitHub repo
- [ ] Build branch set to "main"
- [ ] Environment variables configured

### After Deployment
- [ ] Site builds successfully
- [ ] Landing page loads

## 🔍 Common Netlify Errors & Fixes

### Error: "Base directory does not exist"
**Fix:** Set `base = ""` in netlify.toml ✅ FIXED

### Error: "Command not found: vite"
**Fix:** Add `npm install` before `npm run build` ✅ FIXED

### Error: "Publish directory not found"
**Fix:** Confirm `publish = "dist"` (for Vite projects)

### Error: "Module not found"
**Fix:** Delete `node_modules` and rebuild:
