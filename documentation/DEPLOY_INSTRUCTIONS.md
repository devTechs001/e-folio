## 📦 GitHub Pages Deployment

### Method 1: Using npm deploy (Quickest)

```

This will:
1. Build your project (`npm run build`)
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to `gh-pages` branch
3. Make your site available at: `https://devtechs001.github.io/e-folio`

### Method 2: GitHub Actions (Automatic)

The workflow file is already created at `.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`

**Steps:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings → Pages
3. Source: **GitHub Actions**
4. Push to main branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy E-Folio"
   git push origin main
   ```

Your site will automatically build and deploy!
